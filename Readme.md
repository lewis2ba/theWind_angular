the Wind is an application built to determine the amount of wind energy being produced by its users. Users can upload their turbines and see how much power they along with the other users are offsetting from the US' total capacity. There is also a handy wind power/energy calculator so anyone can see how much wind power they can generate in any city in the US.

Technologies used: Rails, Javascript, Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap
